# TODO:

Use the capabilities of your sequencer to implement the ADPS9960 protocol and control the sensor.



## Modifications implemented:
Modified pico-examples example for i2c bus scan in PIO. The proximity sensor gave just 2 values 230 or a 231 based on how close to the sensor 
the obstal was. The color data was slightly affected due to light condition in the room. As expected, upon covering the sensor completely, values of and 
a standard value of C was displayed.
